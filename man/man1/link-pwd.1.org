* For each link in Linkfile:
     - =base=$(basename link)=
     - save links previous state
     - replace link with link to $PWD/base

* For each link in Linkfile:
     - restore link to previous state

* Notes
- The state of the link might be to not exist, this will still be saved
  and restored
- All files concerned must be links or the script will abort
- The script alternates between linking and unlinking by leaving a file
  called ACTIVE in the PWD
- The states of links are saved by saving a copy as $PWD/$base.restore
  or by creating a file called $PWD/$base.delete so you should no use
  files with names ending with '.delete' or '.restore'
